# Wine Classification with Neural Network
#### The problem
Classify wines from three wineries by thirteen attributes. 

#### Network settings:
```
Train = 70%, Validation = 15% and Testing = 15%
Number hidden of nodes = 4 
Epochs = 1000
Trainng Function = trainlm
Transfer Function (layer 1) = logsig
Trasnfer Function (layer 2) = purelin 

Accuracy = 99.4%

```
